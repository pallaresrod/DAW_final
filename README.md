<h1>Application for Inventory Management of a Stage Assembly Company</h1>

<p>
  This web application is designed to optimize resource and project management within a stage assembly company. With a focus on operational efficiency, the platform provides users with a set of tools to access and manage critical information related to parts and projects.

Regular users can view relevant data about available parts, including their availability status. On the other hand, administrators have additional privileges that allow them to actively manage the use of parts and maintain a complete record of the stage assemblies carried out.

The assembly record includes essential details such as location, start and end dates, estimated duration, and the current status of the project. This detailed tracking facilitates better planning and management of time and resources.
